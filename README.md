### My Trips Page

- Trips created are displayed as cards. If users click on the card, they are redirected to the Trip Details Page, where they can add a task to their to-do list, as well as reservations, activities, and send an invitation to their friends so they can join the trip.
- Users can choose to edit or delete a particular trip if they want to. I used AJAX for the delete button to delete the trip without reloading the page.
- If users click to edit a trip, they are redirected to the "Edit Trip" page where they can modify or add the reason of the trip, as well as a description.

### Trip Details Page - Invite a friend
